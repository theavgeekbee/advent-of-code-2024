# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„
Advent of Code is a month-long coding challenge in December with problems to solve every day. More info [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

## Solution info
This year, I wrote my AoC solutions in C++. Each problem has an IMPORTANT.txt file that you SHOULD read before running. It contains details on how input should be formatted, as I have not standardized them. They will be standardized across all 31 days later.
